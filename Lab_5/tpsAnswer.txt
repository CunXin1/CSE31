TPS Activity 2:

1.  .dataï¼šdefine the constant
    .word: store the data value
    .text: all the command for the program

2. minus the $t3 value 1, this is to count the loop circle

3. check whether $t3 valie is 0, if it 0, jump to finish

4. In Execute, there are a window for Bkpt, click to add breakpoint

5. Using the run button again to run until the next breakpoint

6. In the register window, we can change the value of different address

7. n is in 0x10010000, initial value is 13, and will decrease to 0.

8. Line 19 syscall is print out a int value, and line 21 syscall is terminate the program
