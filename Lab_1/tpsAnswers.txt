TPS activity 2:

1. I am using a Mac, So I use cmd + space to search, then enter "Terminal" to open it.
	a. Yes, I can open multiple terminal in the same time.
	b. Opening more than one terminal is important for multi-tasking, or login Linux with different users. 

2. I use ls command to view inside the directory, -l for detailed version, -a for all files, -h for readable.

3. I will use cd to change the directory, and cd /Users/ruibosun/Desktop to my Desktop, since my username is ruibosun.

4. I will use mkdir to make a new directory, mkdir CSE31 to get a new directory named CSE31.

2.  Add bookmark to browser.

3. I will type gcc main.c -o main to compile my program. -o is to name the output of my program. In this case, I name it to main.

4. If there are no error message showed on the terminal, then I will know that the program has complied successfully.

5. -c will make the main.c file to main.o file, it's a object file which can't be run.

6. -g will generate the debugging information, it can also be used for gdb to debug.

7. I will type gcc main.c -o cselab1, -o is to name the output of my program. In this case, I name it to cselab1.

8. On mac, If I just enter gcc main.c, it will generate a outfile named a.out

9. I will use ./cselab1 to run the program that I just complied.
