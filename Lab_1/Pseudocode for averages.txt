Pseudocode for averages.c


Define functions:
  checkNumber(num): Returns 1 if sum of digits is even, -1 if odd
  printOutput(count): Prints the ordinal count (like "1st", "2nd")

Start main program:
  Initialize variables for sums and counts of odd and even digit sums
  Loop until user inputs 0:
    Display prompt
    Read user input
    Break loop if input is 0
    Determine if sum of digits is even or odd using checkNumber
    Update appropriate sum and count based on result

  If any numbers entered:
    Display averages for even and odd sums if counts are non-zero
  Else:
    Print "No average to compute"

End main program
