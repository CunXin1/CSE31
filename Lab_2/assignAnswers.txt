Assignment 1

1. The line 25 scanf("%d", input); caused the segmentation fault.

2. Change the line 25, add the & to input, &input 

3. The sum needs to be pointer so that the value sum can pass through main function.

4. Add * before sum so that the sum becomes a pointer, the value in read_values can be passed to main.

Assignment 2

1. When enter "HELLO!" and "hello!", the output is HELLO!hello!. The output is as expected

2. The output becomes HI!hi!hello! The bug is that when new inputs are provided, the program does not properly reset str1,
so residual data from previous operations remains, leading to unexpected output. 

3. The combined length of str1 and str2 can exceed the allocated buffer size, causing a buffer overflow and resulting in undefined behavior.
